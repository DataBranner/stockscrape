stockscrape
===========

*Version* 0.1 20130212

*Author*: David Prager Branner

The goal of this project is to explore web scraping using the headline news service on finance.yahoo.com .

This version is not a true scraper; it merely downloads individual web pages and uses simple regex to isolate the most recent day's headlines.

It is expected that this version will be run from within CODE/ . Run with Python2.7.

Output is a file `stock_report.tex` which compiles correctly at present, using LaTeX.
