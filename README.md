Version 0.1 20130212
Author: David Prager Branner

The goal of this project is to explore web scraping using the headline news service on finance.yahoo.com .

This version is not a true scraper; it merely downloads individual web pages and uses simple regex to isolate the most recent day's headlines.

Output is a .tex file which compiles correctly at present.
