stockscrape2.7
===========

**Version**: 0.2, 20130213

**Author**: David Prager Branner

Goal
----
To explore web scraping using the headline news service on (finance.yahoo.com).

Notes
-----

This version is not a true scraper; it merely downloads individual web pages and uses simple regex to isolate the most recent day's headlines. I intend to use this as a foundation for a true scraper.

It is expected that this version will be run from within `CODE/`. Run with Python2.7.

Output is a file `stock_report.tex` which compiles correctly at present, using LaTeX.                                                                           

New in this version
-------------------
1. Better commenting.
2. Changed name and appended Python version to be used.
